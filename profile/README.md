# Public Archive of Bink

This GitHub organisation is a public archive of the efforts put in by Developers at Bink over 10 years to make a viable product in a market completely against us.

## What was Bink

Bink was a "Payment Linked Loyalty" provider, the concept was simple: You add your Payment Cards to our platform via an App, and then get automatically rewarded Loyalty Points with supported third-parties via a Transaction Matching process.

## How did Transaction Matching work?

We recieved feeds from Card Issuers (Visa, Mastercard, Amex), and feeds from Retailers. Harmonia "matched" items within these two feeds and provided the data back to the retailer.

## The Fall of Bink

Bink unfortunately found itself in liquidation in April of 2024 following an important third-party backing out and the product becoming non-viable in non-UK markets. Efforts were made to sell the company, and one party was very interested, but a critical card issuer decided to discontinue their card linking product making rebooting Bink within a new company impossible.

Due to this, the Bink Source Code is essentially worthless to organisations / for-profit efforts and I [cpressland](https://github.com/cpressland) have made the decision to Open Source the platform for education purposes.
