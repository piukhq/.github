# Public Archive of Bink

This GitHub organisation is a public archive of the efforts put in by Developers at Bink over 10 years to make a viable product in a market completely against us.

## The Fall of Bink

Bink unfortunately found itself in liquidation in April of 2024 following an important third-party backing out and the product becoming non-viable in non-UK markets. Efforts were made to sell the company, and one party was very interested, but a critical card issuer decided to discontinue their card linking product making rebooting Bink within a new company impossible.

Due to this, the Bink Source Code is essentially worthless to organisations / for-profit efforts and I [cpressland](https://github.com/cpressland) have made the decision to Open Source the platform for education purposes.
